# Electric_bill_calculator
This is a sample utility bill calculator for monthly electricity usage.
How to use:
  1. The program will ask you if you want to use the stored value. It may come with test stored values, click/type no
  2. If your choice is yes, it will just ask for previous month's kilowatt usage(meter reading), and current month's meter usage
  3. If choice is not, Enter the unit used. this can be gotten by subtracting the previous month against the past month. i.e. if you are getting the units for december, subtract the meter reading of December from November to get the units used in December
  4. the final result is a comparison between the cost and usage in the previous month vs current month. So it compares the cost between December and January

This is not the final product but a 75% done project
